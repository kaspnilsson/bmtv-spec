# Deep Research Prompt for BMTV Art Car Project

## Research Objective
You are a research specialist helping develop a comprehensive plan for BMTV, a Burning Man art car project. Using the attached plan.md file, systematically research and answer the critical questions identified, providing detailed, actionable information that will enable the team to move from planning to execution.

## Research Priorities
Address questions in the following order of importance:

### 1. CRITICAL: Legal & Safety Requirements (Complete First)
**Research the following regulatory and safety requirements:**

- **Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations** for art car modifications
- **California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)** requirements for modified vehicles and registration
- **Burning Man art car registration** process, timeline, deadlines, and requirements
- **Insurance requirements** for art cars - what's available, costs, coverage options
- **Road legal dimension limits** by state (especially CA to NV route)
- **Vehicle weight distribution** and axle load limits for modified trucks
- **Required safety equipment** for road legal operation (lighting, mirrors, reflectors, etc.)

**Safety Engineering Requirements:**
- **Fire safety regulations** at Burning Man - required equipment, suppression systems
- **Electrical safety standards** for outdoor/dusty environments
- **Structural engineering standards** for wind load resistance (desert conditions)
- **Emergency exit requirements** for performance spaces
- **Capacity limits** and crowd control regulations

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY: Technical Specifications
**Power System Design:**
- Research **total power consumption** calculations for:
  - Short throw projectors suitable for truck bed dimensions
  - Professional sound systems for outdoor events (decibel limits at Burning Man)
  - LED lighting arrays (addressable LED strips/tubes for TV effect)
- **Generator vs battery vs hybrid** power solutions - pros, cons, costs, runtime
- **Noise regulations** for generators at Burning Man
- **Power distribution** and electrical safety in harsh environments

**AV Equipment Research:**
- **Projector specifications** - throw distance, brightness, weather protection for 8-foot truck bed
- **Screen materials** that work in desert conditions (day/night visibility, wind resistance)
- **Professional audio equipment** suitable for art cars - weather resistance, power requirements
- **LED control systems** - hardware and software for VJ-controllable displays

**Construction Engineering:**
- **Steel specifications** - grades, thicknesses, and coatings for harsh desert environment
- **Connection systems** between truck chassis and art car superstructure
- **Collapsible/modular design** principles for transport and setup
- **Foundation/stabilization** requirements for ground support

### 3. HIGH PRIORITY: Detailed Budget Analysis
**Provide comprehensive cost breakdowns with multiple options:**

- **AV Equipment**: Get specific product recommendations and prices
  - Projectors: 3 options from budget to professional
  - Sound systems: Complete setups with power requirements
  - LED lighting: Per-foot costs for addressable strips, controllers, power supplies
  
- **Construction Materials**: Detailed materials list with costs
  - Steel (specific grades, quantities, suppliers)
  - Fasteners, hardware, welding materials
  - Electrical components, wiring, safety equipment
  - Covering materials (aluminet vs alternatives)

- **Professional Services**: Research costs for
  - Structural engineering consultation
  - Electrical system design
  - Professional welding/fabrication (hourly rates in Nevada/California)
  - Insurance (annual costs, coverage options)

**Create 3 budget scenarios: Basic, Mid-tier, Premium**

### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Project Planning & Logistics
**Timeline Development:**
- **Phase-gate approach** - what must be completed before next phase can begin
- **Critical path analysis** - which tasks are blocking others
- **Seasonal considerations** - best times for construction, testing, transport
- **Permit timeline** - how long do approvals take, when to start process
- **Vehicle acquisition strategy** - when to buy, what to look for

**Team & Skills Analysis:**
- **Required certifications** (welding, electrical, etc.)
- **Professional vs DIY** cost-benefit analysis for different components
- **Skill development timeline** - what can team members learn vs must hire out
- **Project management tools** and methodologies for distributed team

### 5. LOWER PRIORITY: User Experience & Content
- **Interactive element** design principles and best practices
- **Content management** systems for live events
- **Integration opportunities** with other art cars or Burning Man camps
- **Accessibility considerations** for diverse audiences

## Research Methodology Instructions

**For each question, provide:**
1. **Multiple credible sources** - include URLs, publication dates, author credentials
2. **Specific numbers** - costs, dimensions, timelines, specifications
3. **Alternative approaches** - pros/cons of different solutions
4. **Real-world examples** - similar projects, case studies, lessons learned
5. **Action items** - specific next steps with timelines
6. **Risk factors** - what could go wrong, mitigation strategies

**Research Quality Standards:**
- **Verify information** across multiple sources
- **Prioritize recent data** (2023-2025) especially for costs and regulations
- **Focus on practical implementation** - actionable advice over theory
- **Include failure modes** - what problems do similar projects encounter?
- **Regional specificity** - California/Nevada regulations and suppliers when relevant

**Format your findings as:**
- **Executive summary** for each major section
- **Detailed findings** with source citations
- **Recommendation matrix** comparing options
- **Updated budget estimates** with confidence intervals
- **Next steps** with specific deadlines and responsible parties

## Expected Deliverable
A comprehensive research report that transforms the current open questions into specific, actionable plans with concrete numbers, timelines, and implementation strategies. The goal is to have enough detail to begin Phase 1 (vehicle acquisition) and get firm quotes for Phase 2 (design and fabrication).

**Success Criteria:** After reviewing your research, the team should be able to:
1. Apply for all necessary permits and registrations
2. Get accurate quotes from contractors
3. Create a detailed project timeline with milestones
4. Make informed go/no-go decisions on the project
5. Begin vehicle acquisition with specific criteria
