# BMTV - Burning Man TV Art Car Project

## Project Overview

Tube TV art car where the truck bed becomes the TV screen and the truck cab is inside the "tube." The TV structure extends forward from the truck bed to approximately the rear of the cab, creating a performance stage area behind the cab but forward of the rear axle.

**Key Spatial Layout:**
- **TV Screen**: Truck bed tailgate area (retractable projection screen)  
- **TV "Tube"**: LED scaffolding extending forward ~8-10 feet to rear cab line
- **Stage Area**: Between cab and rear axle (weight-limited performance space)
- **Audience**: Views screen from behind the truck

**Base Vehicle:** F350 dually or similar

**Timeline:** On playa by Burning Man 2027

**Critical Engineering Constraints:** 
- The stage area is a cantilever structure extending forward from the rear axle, creating significant tipping moment
- **Must be driveable while fully deployed** - no ground support legs or external stabilizers allowed
- All structural loads must be supported entirely by truck frame and suspension
- This fundamentally limits stage capacity and requires conservative structural engineering

## Core Philosophy

### Technical Requirements
- Car must be capable of driving itself to the playa
- Car should have at least mid-tier art car audio
- Car should be built to work with or withstand the elements on the playa (waterproofing and dust proofing, wind resistance / usage of porous materials to counteract wind)
- Make use of collapsible bits, custom fabrication wherever possible

### Project Philosophy: Keep It Achievable
- **Minimal viable product approach** - build something awesome but achievable
- **Fun over perfection** - prioritize getting to playa over gold-plating features
- **Don't bite off more than we can chew** - realistic scope for team skills and timeline
- **Descope ambitious features** - many cool ideas exist but may be too complex for v1
- **Iterate and improve** - build solid foundation, add features in future years
- **Team sustainability** - project should be enjoyable, not overwhelming
- **Budget consciousness** - keep costs reasonable to maintain team buy-in

### Scope Management Principles
- **Core functionality first**: TV screen, sound, basic LED lighting, safe stage
- **Nice-to-haves second**: Advanced VJ controls, complex interactivity, elaborate mechanisms
- **Complex engineering last**: Only if team has expertise and timeline allows
- **When in doubt, simplify**: Choose simpler solution over more impressive but risky option

## Alternatives Considered

### Deployable Ground Support Structure
**Concept:** Use deployable legs/outriggers that extend to the ground when parked, allowing for larger stage capacity and reduced cantilever stress on the truck.

**Pros:**
- Much higher stage capacity (more people)
- Reduced structural stress on truck frame
- More stable platform for performances
- Could allow for larger/heavier LED structure
- Lower engineering complexity for the cantilever design

**Cons:**
- Setup/teardown time required at each location
- Cannot drive while deployed in "fun mode"
- Reduces spontaneous mobility during events
- Additional mechanical systems (deployment mechanisms)
- Ground conditions on playa may not support outriggers
- Storage of deployable components during transport

**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Eliminated because core requirement is to drive while fully deployed in performance mode. The mobility and spontaneous movement capability is essential to the art car concept. Also aligns with "keep it simple" philosophy - fewer moving parts and mechanisms.

### Fixed vs Collapsible TV Structure
**Decision:** **TBD** - Need to research if permanent structure meets road legal requirements vs collapsible structure that deploys for events.

### Screen Location Alternatives

#### Option A: Screen at Truck Bed (SELECTED)
**Concept:** Projection screen integrated with tailgate/truck bed, audience views from behind truck.
**Pros:** Natural integration with truck bed, projector protected in bed, clear audience positioning
**Cons:** Fixed throw distance (~8ft), audience must be behind truck (exhaust/heat)

#### Option B: Screen at Front of TV Structure  
**Concept:** Screen at front of cantilever structure, projector in middle of stage.
**Pros:** Flexible projector distance, audience can be at sides, more "TV-like" appearance
**Cons:** Projector exposed to elements, complex screen mechanism, projector blocks performer space
**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Projector exposure and reduced stage space

### Base Vehicle Alternatives

#### Heavy Duty Trucks (SELECTED)
**Options:** F350/Ram 3500/Silverado 3500 Dually
**Pros:** High payload capacity, existing research, dual rear wheels for stability
**Cons:** High cost ($50-85k), overkill for some applications

#### Medium Duty Box Trucks
**Concept:** Ford E-450, Isuzu NPR, or similar commercial chassis
**Pros:** Lower cost, more interior space, designed for heavy loads, flat loading surface
**Cons:** Less familiar platform, harder to find used, may not handle cantilever loads as well
**Decision:** **NEEDS RESEARCH** - Should investigate medium duty options

#### Bus Conversion Platform
**Concept:** School bus or transit bus chassis as base
**Pros:** Very long wheelbase (better stability), low cost, huge interior space
**Cons:** Wide turning radius, harder to modify, less "truck" aesthetic
**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Poor maneuverability, doesn't fit art car aesthetic

### Power System Architecture

#### Generator + Battery Hybrid (SELECTED FOR RESEARCH)
**Concept:** Batteries handle base load and power spikes, generator provides steady charging, solar at camp for extended charging
**Pros:** 
- **Peak load management**: Batteries handle high-power audio spikes, avoiding oversized generator
- **Smaller generator**: Can use efficient mid-size generator instead of massive unit for peaks
- **Solar integration**: Can charge from solar at camp for extended operation
- **Quiet operation**: Generator can run at steady optimal RPM, batteries provide silent peaks
- **Power availability**: System works when generator off
**Cons:** Complex system, higher cost, more components to fail, requires camp solar setup

#### Generator Only
**Concept:** Direct generator power to all systems
**Pros:** Simpler system, lower cost, proven reliability
**Cons:** Noise during performance, no power when generator off
**Decision:** **UNDER CONSIDERATION** - May be acceptable if quiet generator found

#### Battery Only
**Concept:** Large lithium battery bank, charge via truck alternator + shore power
**Pros:** Silent operation, simpler system
**Cons:** Limited runtime, complex charging, very high battery cost
**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Runtime limitations for multi-day events

### Stage Access Alternatives

#### Access Through Truck Cab (CURRENT ASSUMPTION)
**Concept:** People enter truck cab normally, then climb through rear cab window or similar to reach stage
**Pros:** Natural integration, protected access route, no additional structure needed
**Cons:** Limited access width, single point of entry/exit, safety concerns, ADA non-compliant

#### External Side Stairs/Platforms
**Concept:** Permanent stairs or platforms on sides of TV structure
**Pros:** Better emergency egress, easier access for equipment, ADA potential, wider access
**Cons:** Adds cantilever load and complexity, may interfere with driving clearance, more structural points
**Decision:** **NEEDS RESEARCH** - May be required for safety/ADA compliance

#### Removable/Deployable Access
**Concept:** Stairs or ramps that deploy when stopped, retract when driving
**Pros:** No driving clearance issues, can be optimized for access, lighter when driving
**Cons:** Violates "drive while deployed" requirement, complexity, setup time
**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Violates core mobility requirement and adds complexity counter to "keep it simple" philosophy

#### Rear Access from Truck Bed
**Concept:** People access stage by climbing up through truck bed area, behind screen
**Pros:** Uses existing truck bed access, minimal additional structure
**Cons:** Interferes with projection setup, limited space, poor emergency egress
**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Conflicts with screen/projection equipment

#### Multiple Access Points
**Concept:** Combination of cab access + side emergency exits
**Pros:** Redundant egress, meets safety codes, accommodates different users
**Cons:** Most complex structurally, highest cost and weight
**Decision:** **LIKELY REQUIRED** - May be necessary for code compliance
