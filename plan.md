# BMTV - Burning Man TV Art Car Project

## Project Overview

Tube TV art car where the truck bed becomes the TV screen and the truck cab is inside the "tube." The TV structure extends forward from the truck bed to approximately the rear of the cab, creating a performance stage area behind the cab but forward of the rear axle.

**Key Spatial Layout:**
- **TV Screen**: Truck bed tailgate area (retractable projection screen)  
- **TV "Tube"**: LED scaffolding extending forward ~8-10 feet to rear cab line
- **Stage Area**: Between cab and rear axle (weight-limited performance space)
- **Audience**: Views screen from behind the truck

**Base Vehicle:** F350 dually or similar

**Timeline:** On playa by 2027

**Critical Engineering Constraint:** The stage area is a cantilever structure extending forward from the rear axle, creating significant tipping moment. This fundamentally limits stage capacity and requires careful structural engineering.

## Core Philosophy

- Car must be capable of driving itself to the playa
- Car should have at least mid-tier art car audio
- Car should be built to work with or withstand the elements on the playa (waterproofing and dust proofing, wind resistance / usage of porous materials to counteract wind)
- Make use of collapsible bits, custom fabrication wherever possible

## Content & Programming

- Silly videos
- DJ sets
- Live performances

## Interactive Elements

- Art cars are cooler if they're interactive. Maybe we could build a big remote that changes channels or something?
- Other ideas welcome 

## Research Completed

### Vehicle Options & Costs
**Primary Option: Ford F350 Dually**

- XLT Regular/Crew Cab DRW: $63,000 - $67,000
- Higher trims (King Ranch): ~$82,000

**Alternative Options:**
- **Ram 3500 Dually**: Highest payload (7,680 lbs), best interior comfort, 35,100 lb towing
- **Chevy Silverado 3500HD Dually**: Max payload 7,290 lbs (2WD), similar capabilities to GMC

**Budget Estimate: $50,000 - $85,000** for suitable base vehicle

### Material & Construction Costs (Partial)
**Frame Construction:**
- **Steel Fabrication**: $6-18/ft for I-beams, $50-150/hr labor, $24-43/sq ft total installed cost
- **Aluminum Alternative**: 3x lighter but 2-3x more expensive material cost
- **Recommendation**: Steel for primary structure, aluminum for weight-sensitive components

**Shade/Covering Materials:**
- **Aluminet Shade Cloth**: 3-4x more expensive than traditional shade cloth, reduces heat by 30%
- **Alternative**: Traditional shade cloth or canvas for budget option

**Estimated total construction materials**: $15,000 - $35,000 (rough estimate)

## Critical Questions & Research Needed

### Legal & Regulatory Requirements (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **DOT regulations for art car modifications?**
- **California DMV requirements for modified vehicles?**
- **Burning Man art car registration process and timeline?**
- **Insurance requirements and costs for art cars?**
- **Road legal dimension limits?** (8.5' width standard, height varies by state)
- **Truck specifications critical for cantilever design:**
  - **Rear axle weight rating** vs actual rear axle load with structure
  - **Wheelbase length** - affects tipping moment calculations
  - **Frame attachment points** - where can cantilever structure safely connect?
  - **Center of gravity** limits before truck becomes unstable
- **Required safety equipment** (lights, mirrors, etc.)?

### Technical Specifications & Design (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Screen and projection system:**
- **Projector placement** - must be behind tailgate, distance fixed by truck bed length (~8ft)
- **Short-throw projector requirements** - specific models that work at 8ft distance
- **Screen integration with tailgate** - motorized vs manual, storage when driving
- **Screen material** that works in daylight vs night at fixed 8ft throw distance?
- **Viewing angle** - audience behind truck, screen angled up or straight back?
- **Weather protection** for projector mounted in/on truck bed

**Audio system:**
- **Sound ordinance limits** at Burning Man?
- **Power requirements** for "epic sound"?
- **Speaker weatherproofing** and dust protection?
- **Audio mixing capabilities** - DJ booth location?

**Power system:**
- **Total power consumption calculation?**
- **Generator vs battery vs hybrid approach?**
- **Runtime requirements** (how many hours per day)?
- **Noise restrictions** for generator use?
- **Backup power options?**

**LED lighting system:**
- **LED tube specifications** (pixel density, weatherproofing)?
- **Control system** - VJ software, hardware interface?
- **Power consumption** for full LED array?
- **Mounting system** for LED tubes on frame?

### Construction & Engineering (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Critical Weight & Balance Constraints:**
- **Rear axle weight limits** - how much stage/structure weight can rear axle support?
- **Center of gravity calculations** - structure extends forward from rear axle
- **Load distribution** - need front stabilizer legs to prevent truck tipping forward?
- **Dynamic loads** - people jumping/dancing on stage affects balance

**Frame design:**
- **Cantilever engineering** - structure extending forward from truck bed anchor point
- **Forward support system** - ground legs required at front of TV tube?
- **Connection method** - must anchor to truck frame, not just bed
- **Stage load rating** - how many people can safely be on stage?
- **Emergency disassembly** procedures if truck needs to move quickly?

**Truck Bed Modifications:**
- **Tailgate integration** with projection screen mechanism
- **Bed reinforcement** for cantilever load anchor points
- **Access panels** for equipment storage under stage

**Materials research:**
- **Steel grade and thickness** for cantilever beam design
- **Fastener specifications** for truck frame attachment points  
- **Paint/coating** for rust prevention?
- **Cable management** for power and data?

### Safety & Risk Assessment (CRITICAL)
**Structural Safety:**
- **Tip-over prevention** - cantilever structure with people creates tipping moment
- **Stage collapse scenarios** - what if cantilever frame fails?
- **Emergency evacuation** from enclosed stage area (only exit through cab area?)
- **Load limits** - maximum people on stage based on rear axle capacity
- **Ground support failure** - backup if front stabilizer legs fail?

**Fire & Emergency Safety:**
- **Fire safety plan** and suppression system in enclosed space
- **Multiple egress routes** - stage area could become trap if only one exit
- **Emergency vehicle access** - can emergency services reach performers?
- **Structural failure modes** and prevention for cantilever design
- **First aid station** location and access
- **Electrical safety** in dusty environment near truck engine/fuel
