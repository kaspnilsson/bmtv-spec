# BMTV - Burning Man TV Art Car Project

## Project Overview

Tube TV made with a scaffolding of LED lights. The TV screen can either be up and used as a projection mapping surface or lowered to reveal the stage area inside, complete with epic sound.

**Base Vehicle:** F350 dually or similar

**Timeline:** On playa by 2027

## Core Philosophy

- Car must be capable of driving itself to the playa
- Car should have at least mid-tier art car audio
- Car should be built to work with or withstand the elements on the playa (waterproofing and dust proofing, wind resistance / usage of porous materials to counteract wind)
- Make use of collapsible bits, custom fabrication wherever possible

## Content & Programming

- Silly videos
- DJ sets
- Live performances

## Interactive Elements

- Art cars are cooler if they're interactive. Maybe we could build a big remote that changes channels or something?
- Other ideas welcome 

## Open Questions & Planning

### Location & Logistics
- **Where do we build it and where does it live?**
  - Safeers house in Nevada City. We can camp there while building over weekends

### Budget & Resources
- **How much money do we need, and when?**
  - Probably needs answers to other open questions

### Team & Skills
- **How many people / what skills are needed?**
  - Welding
  - Projection mapping
  - Electronics
  - ???

### Construction Approach
- **How do we build it? What is the construction like?**
  - **First idea:**
    - Steel beams that we attach together to construct a basic frame
    - Steel sheets for the floor, aluminet or similar to frame out the structure of the TV
    - Manually retractable projector screen
    - LED tubing hung from or attached to the steel tubes to make the TV actually look like a TV in the dark (synced together, changes color, VJ controllable)

### Timeline & Milestones
- **How long will it take and what are some good goals to ensure success?**
  - Aim for a dry run at fourth of juplaya 2027

### Vehicle Transformation
- **How does the transformation from car to art car occur?**
  - Collapsible panels that fit in the flat bed?
  - The above but with a disassembly of the truck bed for more capacity and a flatter surface

### Technical Specifications
- **What AV equipment is needed and what power requirements does it have?**
  - Short throw projector
  - Compact sound that is loud and nice
  - Generator AND lithium battery approach to power

### Capacity & Dimensions
- **How many people should the stage fit?**
  - As many as possible while being safe
- **What are the dimensions of the screen? The car in general?**
  - As big as possible while remaining safe

### Safety & Engineering
- **Safety concerns?**
- **Weight constraints?**
