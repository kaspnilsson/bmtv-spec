# BMTV - Burning Man TV Art Car Project

## Project Overview

Tube TV made with a scaffolding of LED lights. The TV screen can either be up and used as a projection mapping surface or lowered to reveal the stage area inside, complete with epic sound.

**Base Vehicle:** F350 dually or similar

**Timeline:** On playa by 2027

## Core Philosophy

- Car must be capable of driving itself to the playa
- Car should have at least mid-tier art car audio
- Car should be built to work with or withstand the elements on the playa (waterproofing and dust proofing, wind resistance / usage of porous materials to counteract wind)
- Make use of collapsible bits, custom fabrication wherever possible

## Content & Programming

- Silly videos
- DJ sets
- Live performances

## Interactive Elements

- Art cars are cooler if they're interactive. Maybe we could build a big remote that changes channels or something?
- Other ideas welcome 

## Research Completed

### Vehicle Options & Costs
**Primary Option: Ford F350 Dually**
- Used 2024 models: $49,999 - $83,450
- XLT Regular/Crew Cab DRW: $63,000 - $67,000
- Higher trims (King Ranch): ~$82,000

**Alternative Options:**
- **Ram 3500 Dually**: Highest payload (7,680 lbs), best interior comfort, 35,100 lb towing
- **Chevy Silverado 3500HD Dually**: Max payload 7,290 lbs (2WD), similar capabilities to GMC
- **GMC Sierra 3500HD Dually**: Payload increases from 4,185 lbs (SRW) to 5,607 lbs (DRW)

**Budget Estimate: $50,000 - $85,000** for suitable base vehicle

### Material & Construction Costs (Partial)
**Frame Construction:**
- **Steel Fabrication**: $6-18/ft for I-beams, $50-150/hr labor, $24-43/sq ft total installed cost
- **Aluminum Alternative**: 3x lighter but 2-3x more expensive material cost
- **Recommendation**: Steel for primary structure, aluminum for weight-sensitive components

**Shade/Covering Materials:**
- **Aluminet Shade Cloth**: 3-4x more expensive than traditional shade cloth, reduces heat by 30%
- **Alternative**: Traditional shade cloth or canvas for budget option

**Estimated total construction materials**: $15,000 - $35,000 (rough estimate)

## Critical Questions & Research Needed

- **Electrical safety** in dusty environment?
- **Structural failure modes** and prevention?
- **First aid station** location and access?
- **Capacity limits** - how many people safely?
- **Fall protection** for elevated areas?
- **Guy-wire or stabilization** requirements?

### Budget & Financial Planning (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Detailed cost breakdown needed:**
- ✅ Vehicle: $50-85k (researched)
- ❓ AV equipment: projector ($2-10k?), sound system ($5-15k?), power ($3-8k?)
- ❓ LED lighting system ($3-10k?)
- ❓ Tools and equipment rental/purchase ($2-5k?)
- ❓ Labor costs if hiring welders/fabricators?
- ❓ Insurance and permits ($1-3k annually?)
- ❓ **TOTAL PROJECT ESTIMATE NEEDED**

**Funding strategy:**
- **Payment timeline** - when is money needed?
- **Sponsor opportunities** or grants available?
- **Cost sharing** among team members?

### Team & Skills Requirements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
