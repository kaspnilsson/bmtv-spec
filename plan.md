# BMTV

Burning Man TV, an art car project

- idea: tube TV made with a scaffolding of LED lights, the TV screen can either be up and used as a projection mapping surface or lowered to reveal the stage area inside  
- Complete with pretty epic sound  
- Base vehicle: f350 dually or similar   
- Philosophy   
  - Car must be capable of driving itself to the playa  
  - Car should have at least mid tier art car audio   
  - Car should be built to work with or withstand the elements on the playa (waterproofing and dust proofing, wind resistance / usage of porous materials to counteract wind)  
  - Make use of collapsible bits, custom fabrication wherever possible   
- Timeline: on playa by 2027  
- Content:  
  - Silly videos  
  - DJ sets  
  - Live performances   
- Interactive elements   
  - Art cars are cooler if they're interactive. Maybe we could build a big remote that changes channels or smth?  
  - Other ideas welcome 

## Open questions 

- where do we build it and where does it live   
  - Safeers house in Nevada City. We can camp there while building over weekends   
- How much money do we need, and when  
  - Probably needs answers to other open questions   
- How many people / what skills are needed  
  - Welding  
  - Projection mapping  
  - Electronics   
  - ???  
- How do we build it? What is the construction like?  
  - First idea:   
    - steel beams that we attach together to construct a basic frame,   
    - steel sheets for the floor, aluminet or similar to frame out the structure of the TV  
    - Manually retractable projector screen  
    - LED tubing hung from or attached to the steel tubes to make the TV actually look like a TV in the dark (synced together, changes color, VJ controllable)  
-  How long will it take and what are some good goals to ensure success   
  - Aim for a dry run at fourth of juplaya 2027  
- How does the transformation from car to art car occur?  
  - Collapsible panels that fit in the flat bed?  
  - The above but with a disassembly of the truck bed for more capacity and a flatter surface  
- What AV equipment is needed and what power requirements does it have  
  - Short throw projector   
  - Compact sound that is loud and nice  
  - Generator AND lithium battery approach to power   
- How many people should the stage fit?  
  - As many as possible while being safe  
- What are the dimensions of the screen? The car in general?  
  - As big as possible while remaining safe  
- Safety concerns?  
- Weight constraints?
