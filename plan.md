# BMTV - Burning Man TV Art Car Project

## Project Overview

Tube TV art car where the truck bed becomes the TV screen and the truck cab is inside the "tube." The TV structure extends forward from the truck bed to approximately the rear of the cab, creating a performance stage area behind the cab but forward of the rear axle.

**Key Spatial Layout:**
- **TV Screen**: Truck bed tailgate area (retractable projection screen)  
- **TV "Tube"**: LED scaffolding extending forward ~8-10 feet to rear cab line
- **Stage Area**: Between cab and rear axle (weight-limited performance space)
- **Audience**: Views screen from behind the truck

**Base Vehicle:** F350 dually or similar

**Timeline:** On playa by 2027

**Critical Engineering Constraints:** 
- The stage area is a cantilever structure extending forward from the rear axle, creating significant tipping moment
- **Must be driveable while fully deployed** - no ground support legs or external stabilizers allowed
- All structural loads must be supported entirely by truck frame and suspension
- This fundamentally limits stage capacity and requires conservative structural engineering

## Core Philosophy

- Car must be capable of driving itself to the playa
- Car should have at least mid-tier art car audio
- Car should be built to work with or withstand the elements on the playa (waterproofing and dust proofing, wind resistance / usage of porous materials to counteract wind)
- Make use of collapsible bits, custom fabrication wherever possible

## Alternatives Considered

### Deployable Ground Support Structure
**Concept:** Use deployable legs/outriggers that extend to the ground when parked, allowing for larger stage capacity and reduced cantilever stress on the truck.

**Pros:**
- Much higher stage capacity (more people)
- Reduced structural stress on truck frame
- More stable platform for performances
- Could allow for larger/heavier LED structure
- Lower engineering complexity for the cantilever design

**Cons:**
- Setup/teardown time required at each location
- Cannot drive while deployed in "fun mode"
- Reduces spontaneous mobility during events
- Additional mechanical systems (deployment mechanisms)
- Ground conditions on playa may not support outriggers
- Storage of deployable components during transport

**Decision:** **REJECTED** - Eliminated because core requirement is to drive while fully deployed in performance mode. The mobility and spontaneous movement capability is essential to the art car concept.

### Fixed vs Collapsible TV Structure
**Decision:** **TBD** - Need to research if permanent structure meets road legal requirements vs collapsible structure that deploys for events.

## Content & Programming

- Silly videos
- DJ sets
- Live performances

## Interactive Elements

- Art cars are cooler if they're interactive. Maybe we could build a big remote that changes channels or something?
- Other ideas welcome 

## Research Completed

## Critical Questions & Research Needed

### Legal & Regulatory Requirements (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **DOT regulations for art car modifications?**
- **California DMV requirements for modified vehicles?**
- **Burning Man art car registration process and timeline?**
- **Insurance requirements and costs for art cars?**
- **Road legal dimension limits?** (8.5' width standard, height varies by state)  
- **Drive-while-deployed regulations** - are there special rules for structures on moving vehicles?
- **Truck specifications critical for pure cantilever design:**
  - **Rear axle weight rating** vs actual rear axle load with structure + people
  - **Wheelbase length** - affects tipping moment calculations (longer = more stable)
  - **Frame attachment points** - where can cantilever structure safely connect to chassis?
  - **Center of gravity** limits before truck becomes unstable while driving
  - **Suspension capacity** - can truck suspension handle cantilever moment plus road forces?
- **Required safety equipment** (lights, mirrors, etc.) for permanent structure

### Technical Specifications & Design (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Screen and projection system:**
- **Projector placement** - must be behind tailgate, distance fixed by truck bed length (~8ft)
- **Short-throw projector requirements** - specific models that work at 8ft distance
- **Screen integration with tailgate** - motorized vs manual, storage when driving
- **Screen material** that works in daylight vs night at fixed 8ft throw distance?
- **Viewing angle** - audience behind truck, screen angled up or straight back?
- **Weather protection** for projector mounted in/on truck bed

**Audio system:**
- **Sound ordinance limits** at Burning Man?
- **Power requirements** for "epic sound"?
- **Speaker weatherproofing** and dust protection?
- **Audio mixing capabilities** - DJ booth location?

**Power system:**
- **Total power consumption calculation?**
- **Generator vs battery vs hybrid approach?**
- **Runtime requirements** (how many hours per day)?
- **Noise restrictions** for generator use?
- **Backup power options?**

**LED lighting system:**
- **LED tube specifications** (pixel density, weatherproofing)?
- **Control system** - VJ software, hardware interface?
- **Power consumption** for full LED array?
- **Mounting system** for LED tubes on frame?

### Construction & Engineering (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Critical Weight & Balance Constraints (DRIVE-WHILE-DEPLOYED):**
- **Rear axle weight limits** - structure + people must not exceed truck's rear axle rating
- **Center of gravity calculations** - cantilever load affects truck stability while driving
- **No external supports allowed** - everything supported by truck frame only
- **Dynamic loads while moving** - structure must handle driving forces + people on stage
- **Suspension limitations** - truck suspension must handle cantilever moment while driving

**Frame design:**
- **Pure cantilever engineering** - NO ground support legs allowed
- **Truck frame integration** - must distribute loads properly to chassis
- **Drive-ready design** - structure must be permanently attached and road-safe
- **Conservative load rating** - stage capacity severely limited by no-external-support rule
- **Aerodynamics** - structure must not create dangerous wind loads while driving

**Truck Bed Modifications:**
- **Tailgate integration** with projection screen mechanism
- **Bed reinforcement** for cantilever load anchor points
- **Access panels** for equipment storage under stage

**Materials research:**
- **Steel grade and thickness** for cantilever beam design
- **Fastener specifications** for truck frame attachment points  
- **Paint/coating** for rust prevention?
- **Cable management** for power and data?

### Safety & Risk Assessment (CRITICAL)
**Structural Safety (DRIVE-WHILE-DEPLOYED):**
- **Driving stability** - truck must remain stable while driving with people on cantilever stage
- **No backup supports** - if cantilever fails, no ground legs to catch it
- **Conservative design required** - significant safety margins needed without external supports
- **Stage collapse scenarios** - catastrophic failure modes without ground supports
- **Emergency evacuation while moving** - people must be able to safely exit moving vehicle
- **Load limits** - maximum people severely constrained by pure cantilever design

**Fire & Emergency Safety:**
- **Fire safety plan** and suppression system in enclosed space
- **Multiple egress routes** - stage area could become trap if only one exit
- **Emergency vehicle access** - can emergency services reach performers?
- **Structural failure modes** and prevention for cantilever design
- **First aid station** location and access
- **Electrical safety** in dusty environment near truck engine/fuel
